# Front-end Todo:

## Very Important (Do this first!)
1. fix auth.guard
1. make urls all lowercased.
1. Clean up project internally
  * Clean up navcomponent.ts, make ngOnViewChecked() call less
2. Clean up project interface
  * Make the hidden form alerts float to the right so they don't change the height of the elements
  * Make checkboxes look nicer
  * Fix list dropdown in account creation
3. Complete Home Page, add parallax scrolling
4. Complete Planner Page
5. Complete Settings Page
6. Complete Daily bulletin Page and delete 
7. Complete Lunch Page
8. Cdd Daily Bulletin Page
9. Add user backgrounds
10. Get routing to work
11. Display errors, warnings, and other information
12. Server-side Angular rendering
13. create login page

## Low Priority
- Enable user to get the schedule of any day he wants.
- The tomorrow schedule on main page doesn't display time.
- Getting Started page with redirect after account registration
